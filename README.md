This project includes three JavaScript functions solving three different problems:

1.Calculating the grades f students
2.Detecting the speed of a car 
3.Calculating an individual's net salary-NSSF,KRA,NHIF

E - less than 40
The code is in student.js
problem 2.Speed calculation 
The function calculates the speed based off different criteria.If statment is used so as to execute the different lvels of code block.The solution code is in speed.js


Problem 3: Net Salary Calculation
